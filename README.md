# Cosmic-Inflation-A-Brief-Review

# Abstract

This article briefly reviews the cosmic inflation, both theory and observation. Cosmic inflation is believed to occured in between GUT epoch and recombination epoch. During the inflation epoch, the universe expanded rapidly, and was cooled down from the GUT epoch. This inflation was governed by the scalar field *inflaton*. The mechanism is believed to be that the inflaton slowly moved toward its vacuum state. Inflation happened during the inflaton's movement, and ended when the inflaton broke the condition for this slow movement, called *slow-roll* mechanism. Once the inflation ended, the inflaton dampedly osciallated around its vacuum state, and released energy for particle creation and reheating the universe. Then, the universe passed from the reheat epoch to the recombination epoch which can be described by the standard universe model since then. Interestingly, introducing quantum fluctuation during the inflation can produce the primodial fluctuation which is responsible for inhomogeneities observed today in our univserse such as CMB anisotropy and galaxies. CMB anisotropy has been used as a probe to study the early universe. The recent data from @planck2015 supported the prediction from cosmic inflation model called $R^2$ inflation.
